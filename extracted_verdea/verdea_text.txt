About Us.
Verdea is a forward-thinking company founded on the belief that sustainability and innovation must go
hand in hand to build a better future. Our products are crafted from old clothes that can still be used, giving
another purpose to those garments by transforming them into something new, to help reduce the 92
million tonnes of textile waste produced every year. As our company grows, we strive to innovate and
produce more sustainable products that continue to align with our mission. The name Verdea comes from
the words verde (green) and idea, symbolizing our commitment to bringing fresh, innovative, and eco-
conscious solutions to the world’s growing environmental challenges.
At Verdea, we operate between creativity and sustainability, specializing in upcycling textiles to create
unique, environmentally friendly products. Our products are meticulously designed to minimize waste and

We recognize that the future of our planet depends on the actions we take today. That is why we are
dedicated to creating smart solutions—products and services that are not only efficient and practical but
also aligned with the principles of environmental responsibility.
Guided by our slogan, “Smart Solutions,
Sustainable World,” we go beyond offering
short-term fixes. We aim to create long-lasting
change by fostering innovation that reduces
carbon footprints, conserves resources, and
promotes circular economies. Our projects and
partnerships

NuVida
BY VERDEA
BY VERDEA
The name NuVida comes from the mix of the words ‘new’ and ‘vida’ which
means “life”. It symbolizes the new life given to old and unused fabrics and
clothes. Similar to Verdea, which merges "verde" (green) and "idea," NuVida
carries the same mission of sustainability and innovation. This name embodies
the idea that old materials can be reimagined into something new, useful, and
eco-conscious. It also serves as a reminder that small actions like opting a tote
bag made of up-cycled materials can help build a smarter and greener world.
The NuVida Tote Bag is an eco-friendly product
made from recycled materials such as denims and
old clothes that would otherwise go to waste.
These textiles are carefully repurposed and turned
into strong and stylish tote bags instead of throwing
them away. NuVida is designed to be sustainable
and practical, offering a better alternative to
traditional plastic and cotton bags.
Crafted with Verdea’s commitment to sustainability
and innovation, the aim is to introduce a product
that is more than just an accessory but a statement
about living consciously. Every piece is made to
help 
reduce 
textile 
wastes, 
conserving 
our
resources, and give clothes a new life in a cycle.

Our business exists to tackle the huge problem of old clothes
and fabric scraps that are thrown into landfills every year. This
massive amount of trash harms our environment, and our
primary reason for being is to cut down on that waste.
RATIONALE
RATIONALE
The good work we do has a wide impact. We help the
environment by directly reducing pollution and saving
resources. We help the community by supporting local
production. And we help our customers by giving them a
product that is both high-quality and an easy way for them to
support a cleaner, more sustainable world.
06
This is about how we run our operations. Even as we use old
materials, we make sure our own production process is very
smart and lean. We design our cutting and sewing to use
almost all of the fabric we have, so we don't create new trash.
This makes our commitment to reducing waste even stronger.
This is how we fix the problem in the first point. Instead of
letting fabric go to waste, we collect it and give it a second
life by transforming it into brand-new, durable tote bags. By
repurposing the waste, we keep it out of the trash and avoid
using fresh resources to make new materials.

Customer Segments
Eco-conscious consumers
Eco-friendly consumers are one of the primary customer bases for
reusable tote bags. Such consumers are well attuned to environmental
problems like plastic waste and global warming. They opt for
sustainable options and are inclined towards using reusable bags over
disposable plastics. This consumer base constitutes the primary target
market since they willingly look for environmentally friendly products
that resonate with their values.
Students and Young Professionals
Another crucial segment consists of young professionals and students.
Tote bags are not only convenient for holding books, laptops, and
personal accessories, but are also stylish and multi-purpose. This
segment appreciates the functionality and style aspect, making tote
bags a desirable daily accessory.
Key Resources
Reusable materials 
Reusable tote bags are often made from durable and eco-friendly materials that
ensure long-lasting use while reducing environmental impact. Common options
include cotton or canvas, which are natural, strong, and washable, making them
ideal for everyday use.
Staffs 
Staff bring the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to achieve goals
and deliver quality services. Unlike physical assets or technology, employees
contribute creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities that drive
innovation and continuous improvement. Their performance directly impacts
productivity, customer satisfaction, and the overall success of the organization.
Suppliers 
Suppliers provide the raw materials, products, and services needed to sustain
operations and meet customer demands. A reliable supplier ensures consistent
quality, timely delivery, and cost efficiency, which directly affect the
organization’s productivity and competitiveness.
Machinery 
Machinery enables efficient production, consistency in quality, and large-scale
output that human labor alone may not achieve. With the right machines,
businesses can reduce production time, minimize errors, and lower operational
costs, leading to improved productivity and competitiveness.

Channels
Direct Selling 
Verdea can directly sell its NuVida Tote Bags through pop-up booths,
local bazaars, and eco-conscious retail shops. Customers can see,
touch, and appreciate the quality of the bags in person by having a
small physical store or collaborating with sustainable boutiques. 
Online Platforms
An online store and social media pages (Facebook and Instagram) will
be the primary platforms for marketing of the products and sales. These
platforms allow Verdea to reach a wider audience and to target the
younger tech savvy market who spends most of their time shopping
online. Customers can also use these online platforms for the
customization service where they can request customized tote bags
(choosing styles, fabric, or embroidery) making the buying experience
more personal and unique.
Cost Structure
Marketing & Promotion (Social media ads, posters, and promotional
events.)
Expenses for social media advertisements, posters, and promotional events are
necessary to reach customers. These efforts allow the business to build brand
awareness and attract a wider market.
Fixed Costs (Rent for workspace, equipment, and utilities.)
The business also incurs fixed costs such as workspace rent, utilities, and
equipment maintenance. These expenses remain consistent regardless of sales
volume and are essential for ensuring continuous production and operations. A
workspace will be rented at Molmisa Workspaces located along Ortigas-Cainta
Extension provides the business with a convenient and visible location where
major landmarks such as SM East Ortigas and Cainta Municipal Hall are near.
This makes it easier to reach our target market of students and young
professionals.
Raw Materials Supply (Fabrics, threads, embellishments, and adhesives)
Expenses for raw materials such as fabrics, threads, embellishments, and
adhesives are essential for the production of the NuVida tote bags. These
supplies ensure that the products are durable, well-designed, and appealing to
customers. Consistent access to quality raw materials is necessary to maintain
smooth production and meet customer demand.
Revenue Streams
Sales of bags
The revenue that will be applied in this business will be coming from the
sales of bags that will be generated in every transaction.

Looking for a solution to textile waste, Retaso, whose name means “scraps”
in Filipino, seeks to find value and purpose in what has been discarded. By
refining, upcycling, and repurposing textile scraps, Retaso transforms these
materials into sustainable and environmentally friendly products that can be
used every day, with a particular focus on bags.
The initiative was founded by Tasha and Bella Tanjutco in 2019 to address
the growing textile waste problem in the Philippines. Each product is crafted
from 98-100% recycled plastic, as Retaso partners with various local brands
and designers to help reduce the textile waste that might otherwise end up in
our oceans. As the initiative has grown into a social enterprise, it is now
managed by Natasha Soriano and Hannah Garcia.
Globally, only 1% of textile waste is recycled. With fast fashion ranking as the
second-largest contributor to pollution after oil, Retaso strives to raise
awareness, inspire action, and offer solutions to textile waste. Additionally,
the enterprise promotes sustainability by upcycling excess local fabric and
supports fair trade and empowerment for local Filipino seamstresses and
brands, who play a crucial role in crafting their products.

ELIMINATE
RAISE

CREATE
Eliminate the unnecessary costs to improve pricing
value perception - Verdea should realize the price gap
with Retaso. In the strategy canvas, it describes the value
of elements from low to high value. Since Verdea’s score
of 3 is lower than Retaso’s 4, it implies that Verdea is too
costly compared to its competitor, which gained better
value for money.
Eliminating unnecessary costs will lower the price and
enhance its perceived value, bringing it closer to that of
the competitor.
Strengthen great design to maintain high position - As
Verdea is stronger than Retaso in terms of design, it still
needs to maintain its position through brand improvement
by making the products not only beautiful but also more
efficient and practical than before. 
Quality and Durability of Products - Since Verdea is
focused on eco-friendliness, it should elevate the quality
and durability of the products to strengthen its competitive
advantage over Retaso. Although Retaso emphasizes
creativity and sustainability by making use of patchwork
scrap fabrics, the various product levels of quality may
depend on the scraps available at the time. On the other
hand, Verdea can elevate quality by knowing that every bag
will be made from quality products and last a long time.
Reduce or limit the variety of materials used in the
products - It is important to choose the right materials
that should be good in order to make the product. Do an
inspection first to the materials that are going to be used
for the production of goods. Limiting the variety of
materials can make the quality of the product consistent
and assured that it will be well made.
New Market and Local Empowerment - To be a leading
tote bag brand like Retaso, Verdea should create a new
market for sustainable, eco-friendly bags that appeal to
environmentally conscious individuals and organizations.
Make a difference by building durability testing, comfort
design, and eco-certifications into its brand promise. Also it
should create opportunities for local seamstresses and
artisans to contribute to sustainable fashion practices and
support local economies.
