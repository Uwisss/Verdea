      <h2>About Verdea</h2>
      <p>Verdea is a forward-thinking company founded on the belief that sustainability and innovation must go hand in hand to build a better future. Our products are crafted from old clothes that can still be used, giving another purpose to those garments by transforming them into something new.</p>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>To create smart solutions that reduce carbon footprints, conserve resources, and promote circular economies through upcycled products.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>To become a widely recognized brand for innovative, ethically-made, eco-friendly bags that blend style with purpose.</p>

      <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      <p>We collect local textiles and work with local tailors in Taytay, Rizal to produce durable, customizable tote bags. Our manufacturing process is designed to maximize fabric usage and minimize waste.</p>
